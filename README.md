# DrugProt-drug-chemical-protein-relation-extraction
This repository includes pytorch codes for using domain-specific BERT models, along with proposed const-BERT variants on the Drugprot track of BioCreative VII Challenge.

## data
We extracted and pre-processed the original dataset from the official DrugProt task website:
https://biocreative.bioinformatics.udel.edu/tasks/biocreative-vii/track-1/

The processed data is converted to several .csv files, for convenience, it is downloadable here:
